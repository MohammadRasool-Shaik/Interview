## Concepts to Learn

### ACID Properties(To ensure the reliability and integrity of transactions, especially when dealing with multiple users accessing the data should be consistent)

* Atomicity
* Consistency
* Isolation (Meaning Independent)
* Durability

Isolation levels define the degree to which a transaction must be isolated from the data modifications made by any other
transaction in the database system. A transaction isolation level is define by the following phenomena:

#### Database Anomalies

* Dirty Read
* Non-Repeatable Read
* Phantom Read

#### Based on these phenomena, defines four isolation levels:

#### Isolation: To determines how transaction integrity is visible to other users and systems.

* Read Un-Committed
* Read Committed
* Repeatable Reads
* Serializable
